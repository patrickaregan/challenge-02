            <article>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Louisiana so I have an engrained love for cajun food. One of my favorites is boudin,
                    pronounced "BOO-dan", a spicy pork and rice mixture stuffed into a sausage casing. I'm also
                    half Korean so I have a hereditary love for Korean food as well, especially Korean BBQ. What
                    I love most about Korean BBQ, besides the marinated meats cooked for you at the table,
                    are the small side dishes of vegetables called Banchan. It's like comfort food for me.
                </p>

                    After high school I joined the Navy and was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In Hawaii I learned
                    to surf and love hawaiian food. I also received my bachelor's degree from Hawaii Pacific University
                    in Business Administration. While at school I took a computer course that taught me about databases
                    using Microsoft Access. That peaked my interest in databases and programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After leaving the military I came back home to Louisiana and worked in food service for a short time
                    then moved to Austin, Texas for a job as a Systems Support Specialist. My responsibility in that
                    job was to create reports and send them to state agencies but I also managed an internal website
                    using Cold Fusion and SQL Server.
