                    I grew up in Louisiana so I have an instinctual love for cajun food. One of my favorites is boudin,
                    pronounced "BOO-dan", a spicy pork, rice and vegtable mixture stuffed into a sausage casing. The links are easy to eat and great
                    for breakfast or a late night snack. It's definately cajun comfort food and every small
                    town between Beaumont and New Orleans will have boudin.

                    I'm half Korean so I naturally love Korean food, especially Korean BBQ. What
                    I love most about Korean BBQ, besides the marinated meats grilled at the table,
                    are the small side dishes of vegetables called Banchan. They come out at the start of the meal and
                    give you something to much on before the main course. Marinated cucumbers, bean sprouts, and seaweed
                    salad are some examples and most people eat them with a bit of steamed rice that normally comes out
                    with the banchan. There are many more types of banchan and each restaurant may be different depending
                    on what vegetables are in season.

                <p class="about-me">
                    After high school I joined the Navy and was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In my free
                    time I learned to surf and went to college at Hawaii Pacific University where I earned a
                    bachelors degree in Business Administration. One of my computer courses taught me about databases
                    and that got me interested in Information Technology.
                </p>
                <p class="about-me">
                    After the military and college I found my way to Austin, Texas and started a career
                    in Information Technology. My first job in this new career was as a Systems Support Specialist
                    for the Texas Department of Human Services. I learned how to make websites dynamic with
                    data from databases using Cold Fusion and SQL Server. Then I moved on to Austin Community
                    College where I developed a web-based budget development system for the college to allocate funds
                    to each department for the upcoming year. It was built with Active Server Pages and SQL Server. I eventually moved to a Database administrator
                    position at the community college before I moved on to the private sector.

                <p class="about-me">
                    My first job after leaving Austin Community College was as a contractor working for Dell.
                    My job was to support their order processing system at one of the fulfillment centers in
                    Austin. This was a web application running on Active Server Pages and SQL Server. It
                    ingested and correlated data from several other Dell databases and let the pickers on
                    the fullfillment center floor know what items to put into each shipping box that came down
                    the line. This job was a night and day difference from my job at the community college or
                    the state agency. Those jobs were very laid back and low stress. This job, supporting
                    the order processing system, was higher stakes because there were about 100 employees
                    at any time depending on the system to do their job and get orders shipped. And when
                    the sytem was down they could not work so they were getting paid to do nothing. It was
                    on one of the incident conference calls where I first heard an incident manager calculate
                    the monetary impact of the system being down. It was tough and stressful but it was great
                    experience for my next job.

                <p class="about-me">
                    My career at Visa started as a contractor supporting Verified by Visa. I was responsible
                    for change and incident management. After 10 months as a contractor I converted to a full time employee and have been at Visa ever since. I have been
                    at Visa for over 15 years and have been a Programmer Analyst, Systems Engineer, Manager, Director
                    and currently a Sr. Director of Product Reliability Engineering. Visa is a great place to work and
                    I am very proud to be a part of it.
