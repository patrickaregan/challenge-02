                <p>
                    I grew up in Louisiana so I have an engrained love for cajun food. One of my favorites is boudin,
                    pronounced "BOO-dan", a spicy pork and rice mixture stuffed into a sausage casing. I'm also
                    half Korean so I have a hereditary love for Korean food as well, especially Korean BBQ. What
                    I love most about Korean BBQ, besides the marinated meats cooked for you at the table,
                    are the small side dishes of vegetables called Banchan. It's like comfort food for me.

                    After high school I joined the Navy and was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In Hawaii I learned
                    to surf and love hawaiian food. I also received my bachelor's degree from Hawaii Pacific University
                    in Business Administration. While at school I took a computer course that taught me about databases
                    using Microsoft Access. That peaked my interest in databases and programming.

                    After leaving the military I came back home to Louisiana and worked in food service for a short time
                    then moved to Austin, Texas for a job as a Systems Support Specialist. My responsibility in that
                    job was to create reports and send them to state agencies but I also managed an internal website
                    using Cold Fusion and SQL Server.
