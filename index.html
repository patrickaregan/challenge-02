                <p>
                    I grew up in Louisiana so I have an engrained love for cajun food. One of my favorites is boudin,
                    pronounced "BOO-dan", a spicy pork and rice mixture stuffed into a sausage casing. I'm
                    half Korean so I also love Korean food, especially Korean BBQ. What
                    I love most about Korean BBQ, besides the marinated meats cooked at the table,
                    are the small side dishes of vegetables called Banchan. It's my comfort food.

                    After high school I joined the Navy and was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In my free
                    time I learned to surf and went to college at Hawaii Pacific University where I earned a
                    bachelors degree in Business Administration. One of my computer courses led me to databases
                    and that started my interest in Information Technology.

                    After the military I worked in food service for a short time then I got a job as a  
                    System Support Specialist in Austin, Texas. That was my first job in Information Technology.
                    My responsibilities were to create reports and manage an internal web page that was built with
                    Cold Fusion and SQL Server.
