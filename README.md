## Description
- This project is my portfolio website. It tells the reader a little bit about me,
then shows examples of my work and finally, gives the reader multiple ways to contact me.
- It is important to have a portfolio to show potential employers what your past work is like.
A good portfolio can help them decide to hire you.
- It is important for potential employers to see as many examples of your other work so they can
see if you have the skillset they need for their position.
- I learned a lot about CSS in class and am putting it to use here. Some specific things I have learned
are flexbox and media queries. Using flexbox makes it easier to position elements in a container and have
them resize well when the page is smaller. It is important to have the page look good at smaller resolutions
because studies show that most people view websites from their phones where the screen resolution is smaller.
Media queries also helps to make a page look better on smaller screens. I set three breakpoints for smaller
screens much like we did for the run-buddy project.
